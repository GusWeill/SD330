		<h2> Gus Weill's Design Principles </h2>
		<div id ="div1">
		<h2> Accessibility </h2>
		<li> Consider all forms of disability when creating an interactive product.</li>
		<li> Understand sensory impairment, physical impairment, and cognitive impairment before attempting to cater to specific accessibility needs.</li>
		<li> Rely on feedback from those with prior mentioned impairments, and design with them in mind from the start.</li>
		<li> Pair usability with accessibility, with the understanding that an ultimately usable product or app must has accessibility wrapped up in it.</li>
		<li> Remain open minded. Understand that many products that were designed for the sole purpose of accessibility came into their own as incredibly important facets of every day life, such as SMS.</li>
		
		</div>
		<div id = "div2" style =>
		<h2> Usability </h2>
		<li> Maintain standards of efficiency. Avoid tasks taking too many steps.</li>
		<li> Protect your users with safety in mind. Expect errors, and assure that recovery is never out of the question.</li>
		<li> Value the learnability of your product. Have tutorials where necessary, while understanding how much time a user may or may not be willing to spend learning a product.</li>
		<li> Maintain standards of memorabilty. Use contextual icons, meaningful command names, and arrange buttons and tools according to sensible themes.</li>
		<li> Ensure your product has the proper utility. Pack in everything someone who is using your product might need to use your product. </li>
		
		<ul>

		</u1>
		</div>
		<div id = "div3" style=>
		<h2> Conceptualization </h2>
		<li> Understand conceptual models and use them to improve your user experience.</li>
		<li> Make decisions about conceptual design before commencing physical design (such as choosing menus, icons, dialog boxes).</li>
		<li> Use metaphors and analogies to convey to people how to understand what a product is used for and how to use it.</li>
		<li> Be familiar with the various interaction types and which your product uses, be it instructing, conversing, manipulating, exploring, etcetera.</li>
		<li> Think outside of the box, as paradigms, visions, theories, models, and frameworks provide different ways of framing and informing design and research.</li>
		
		</div>
</div>
<div id = "group2" class="floatRight">
		<div id = "div4" style=>
		<h2> Expressivity </h2>
		<li> Understand how emotions affect behavior and how behavior affects the user experience.</li>
		<li> Examine user responses to your products in ways more than simple efficiency.</li>
		<li> Use emotional interaction to guide design choices. What makes people happy, what makes people angry?</li>
		<li> Animate your icons, sonify actions and events, and provide tactile feedback for a more wholesome and expressive experience.</li>
		<li> Be aestehetically pleasing as well as proficient, as that is half the battle when designing a user experience.</li>
		<ul>

        </ul>
		</div>
		<div id = "div5" >
		<h2> Data Gathering </h2>
		<li> Have clear goals with every data gathering mission. Find out what you are trying to find out before looking. </li>
		<li> Run studies to test out the feasibility of a planned data gathering session and associated instruments such as questions.</li>
		<li> Choose appropriate data gathering techniques, depending on the focus of the study, participants involved, nature of the technique, and resources available.</li>
		<li> Gauge a proper level of participation based on your needs. Be either a participant observer or a passive observer, based on how much you need to control.</li>
		<li> Employ triangulation. Examine everything from different perspectives and understand that the real answer may lie somewhere in the middle of them all.</li>
		<li>
